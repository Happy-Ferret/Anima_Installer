Anima_Installer
===============

A modern, HTML5/CSS3 compliant OS installer.

#####Goal

A simple to use (and develop) installer for Anima. 
Current solutions lack many basic multimedia features and are somewhat difficult to customize. 

#####Tools of the Trade

* The frontend will be realized in HTML5/CSS/XUL, utilizing the beginnings of my Junior framework. 
* The backend will use functionally written Shell scripts and some Javascript glue code.
